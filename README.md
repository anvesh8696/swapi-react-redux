# SWAPI React Redux

This is a sample React Redux project using the Star Wars API at https://swapi.co

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
  You must have Node installed

## Usage

#### UI
To run the application (in development mode), assuming you are currently in the project root directory, run the following commands:

    > npm start

The application can be accessed from http://localhost:8080/

#### Unit Tests
Karma and Jasmine are being used to run our unit tests for the application. You can run the test suite by running the following command:
